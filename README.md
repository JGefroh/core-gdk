# core-gdk

`core-gdk` contains reusable game systems I built while writing games with my `core-js` framework.

`/engine` contains implementations of common mechanisms including rendering, audio, collision, and movement.  
`/genre` contains implementations of more specific capabilities for particular genres such as combat and map generation.  


# Dependencies

[core-js](https://github.com/JGefroh/core-js) is a low-level Entity Component System library I wrote. It provides basic objects necessary to run and manage data objects and logic in a game or simulation loop.


# Disclaimer 

This is not intended to be used in a commercial or production environment - it was just a fun hobby project I wrote.
